# AutoReplyBot_Whatsapp
The First Bot I made.<br>
I used pyautogui module of python to create this bot.<br><br>
Well, how to use it? <br>
Firstly, check wether all the position coordinates given in the code are matching.<br>
Secondly we have to open ChatGPT and set it by telling it the way you want it to give reply.<br>
Then Open Whatsapp and select the chat of the friend whom you want to reply with bot.
Finally Run the Code
<br><br>
What it does?<br>
For each of your friends message, it will use chatgpt to generate a reply and send it as Reply in Whatsapp to your friend.
